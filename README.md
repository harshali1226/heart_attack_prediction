# Heart Attack Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive workflow for predicting heart attack risk using patient health data. The project demonstrates data exploration, preprocessing, outlier handling, statistical analysis, model building, and evaluationâ€”all within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes 1,319 patient records with the following features:

- **Age**
- **Gender** (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
- **Heart rate**
- **Systolic blood pressure**
- **Diastolic blood pressure**
- **Blood sugar**
- **CK-MB** (Creatine Kinase-MB)
- **Troponin**
- **Result** (positive = heart attack, negative = no heart attack)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Displayed data samples and summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles) for all features.
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Outlier handling strategies applied to clinical variables.
3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Used t-tests to identify significant differences in features between positive and negative cases.
4. **Model Building**
   - Trained a logistic regression model to predict heart attack risk.
   - Achieved an accuracy of 89%.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.
6. **Feature Importance**
   - Analyzed model coefficients to interpret feature impact.
7. **Visualization**
   - Created boxplots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize distributions and relationships.
   - Provided dashboard design guidance for Tableau.
